Hi, My name is Mary Josephine R. Gamit.

I studied in LPU Manila when I was in Senior High School. Now, I am studying in DLSU-D under the program BS in Computer Science. Recently, I have finished my internship at a Machine Learning/ AI company and it was a nice experience. It feels nice to know that I can apply my learnings from the real workplace, to my thesis project too.
