Hi, My name is Mary Josephine R. Gamit.

I studied in LPU Manila when I was in Senior High School. Now, I am studying in DLSU-D under the program BS in Computer Science. Recently, I have finished my internship at a Machine Learning/ AI company and it was a nice experience. It feels nice to know that I can apply my learnings from the real workplace, to my thesis project too.

I like watching movies that are mind-boggling and keeps me awake at night. My recent favorites are Shutter Island, Oldboy, and The Prestige. In terms of music, I love Taylor Swift and BLACKPINK. I also play the guitar when I have free time. I try to also catch up on the series that are still ongoing, my current favorite is Only murders in the building.
